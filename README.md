# Acadex (Academics Weekly Studio)

Offline-first weekly timetable and attendance tracker built with Next.js (App Router) and `next-pwa`.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` uses webpack (required for `next-pwa`).
- `npm run build` builds with webpack for production.
- `npm run start` runs the production server.

## PWA Notes

- Service worker is generated by `next-pwa` at build time.
- `PwaRegistrar` registers the service worker in production.
- Generated files in `public/` (like `sw.js` and `workbox-*.js`) are ignored in git.

## Deploy on Vercel

1. Push to GitHub and import the repo in Vercel.
2. Vercel builds with `npm run build` automatically.
3. After deploy, verify PWA:
   - DevTools → Application → Service Workers
   - DevTools → Application → Manifest
   - Lighthouse PWA audit
